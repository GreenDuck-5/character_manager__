#AP 1st Period, Character Manager Pseudocode

#create function for creating character
    #Make a list for attributes, all of which will be 0 and in a predetermined spot so we can use the same index to know which number is which
    #Make another list for name, race, gender, and class, which will also have predetermined spots for which index they'll go in
    #Make a list for the inventory which will be blank to start
    #Adjust the stats and inventory based off of their race, class, etc.
    #Save all of it in a list so its together as one character
    #return the list so you can access it outside of the function
